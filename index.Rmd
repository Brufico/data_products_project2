## Zipf's law

In this document, we try to explore the relationship between the population and the rank of the largest cities of the world, using the dataframe `world.cities` of the package `maps`.

This relation between rank and size can been described using **Zipf's law** (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law)).

Originally, Zipf's law states a relationship between the rank and the frequency of words in a language. It can be applied to describe the relation between the size (population) and the rank of cities, among other objects.


## Form of the relationship

A simplified way to state  the form of this relationship is $$population = \frac{K}{rank^s}$$

 $$i.e.\  \log(population) = \log(K) - s \cdot \log(rank)$$


This is a linear relationship between $\log(population)$ and $\log(rank)$
We will thus draw *log/log* scatterplot to investigate further this relationship. 

**Please use Chrome or Edge** to visualize the interactive plot (next page). With Firefox, I could'nt see anything, and I am not the only one with this problem.


## Interactive graph (Chrome/Edge)

Scatterplot of the world's 10 largest cities (log-log axis): 

```{r libs, include = FALSE}
library(maps)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

```
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# data
data("world.cities")
cp <- world.cities
cp <- cp[order(cp$pop, decreasing = TRUE),]
cp$rank <- 1:nrow(cp)
# compute logs
cp$lpop <- log10(cp$pop)
cp$lrank <- log10(cp$rank)

begin <- 1
end <- 10
firstcap <- cp[begin:end, ]


fit <- lm(lpop ~ lrank, data = firstcap)
cf <- coef(fit)
K = 10 ^ cf[1]
s = -cf[2]



```

```{r graph, fig.align="center"}
# the ggplot2 graph
gpop <- ggplot(firstcap,aes(rank, pop, color = name)) +
        geom_point() +
        geom_smooth(method = "lm", mapping = aes(group=1), se = FALSE) +
        scale_x_log10(breaks = 1:10) +
        scale_y_log10(breaks = seq(1,1.6, by=0.1)* (10 ^ 7) ) +
        labs(#title = "World's 10 largest cities: Population vs rank ",
             y = "population") +
        theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "none") + 
        theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "grey", size = 0.1))

# converting to plotly
ggpoply <- ggplotly(gpop)
ggpoply
```

## Fitting an equation

The corresponding fitting equation is: 

```{r}
eqn <- paste0("$$", "Population = \\frac{", 
              format(K, digits = 0, big.mark = "\\\\ ", scientific = 12), 
              "}{rank^{",
              round(s,4),"}}$$")
```
`r eqn`

It seems valid only for the cities with more than 10 millions inhabitants. The equation form holds also for smaller cities, but with  different parameters $K$ and $s$

## Interactive graph: Method

The scatterplot was made using `ggplot2`, and converted to a `Plotly` graph with the function `ggplotly()`:

```{r, ref.label="graph", eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

```
